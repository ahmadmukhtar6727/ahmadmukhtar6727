- 👋 Hi, I’m @ahmadmukhtar6727
- 👀 I'm interested in areas that combine healthcare, laboratory science, and data management. Fields such as health data analytics, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), public health research, and laboratory quality management offer strong career opportunities. You can enhance your skills by learning tools like Excel, Power BI, SPSS, and DHIS2, as well as gaining knowledge in research methods, data visualization, and health information systems. With your experience, roles such as Public Health Analyst, M&E Officer, Clinical Research Assistant, or Health Informatics Officer would be suitable paths to explore.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or building skills in medical data management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and health-related digital tools. This may include working with tools like Excel, DHIS2, or KoboCollect, and gaining practical experience in accurate data entry, reporting, and supporting healthcare programs. You're also likely enhancing your understanding of medical microbiology, especially in relation to diagnostics, infection control, and public health reporting. If you're learning anything specific right now (like Power BI or research methods), let me know and I can tailor this further.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on In the future, I should look to collaborate with public health organizations, research institutions, healthcare NGOs, hospitals, and data-driven health projects. These partners can offer opportunities to apply your medical microbiology and data entry skills in larger-scale health interventions, disease surveillance, M&E, or clinical research. You can also collaborate with laboratories focused on diagnostics and infection control, or with digital health startups working on improving health data systems. Teaming up with professionals in epidemiology, biostatistics, and health informatics will also help you grow and expand your impact in the healthcare sector.
